Uses Fluent to interact with and store that information in a PostgreSQL database
and running that database on Docker

First, create a new directory in your home directory or somewhere sensible to work on your Vapor projects. 
For example, enter the following commands in Terminal:

mkdir vapor
cd vapor

This creates a new directory in your home folder called vapor and navigates you there. Next, create your project with:

vapor new vapor-project-name

The toolbox then asks if you’d like to use Fluent. For now, type n followed by Enter. You’ll learn about Fluent in a future tutorial. 
The toolbox then generates your project for you

To build and start your app, run:

cd vapor-project-name
open Package.swift

This builds and runs the app. The first time you run it, it can take some time since it must fetch all the dependencies. 
The template has a predefined route, so open your browser and visit http://localhost:8080/hello and see the response!

The template contains everything you need to set up your app and you shouldn’t need to change main.swift
or the Run module. Your code lives in App or any other modules you define

## Creating Your Own Routes

Now that you’ve made your first app, it’s time to see how easy it is to add new routes with Vapor

After you open the vapor project, open routes.swift in Sources/App. You’ll see the route you visited above. To create another route, add the following after the app.get("hello") closure:

## What is routing

Routing is the process of finding the appropriate request handler for an incoming request

To understand how routing works in Vapor, you should first understand a few basics about HTTP requests. Take a look at the following example request:

GET /hello/vapor HTTP/1.1
host: vapor.codes
content-length: 0

This is a simple GET HTTP request to the URL /hello/vapor. This is the kind of HTTP request your browser would make if you pointed it to the following URL:

http://vapor.codes/hello/vapor

The first part of the request is the HTTP method. GET is the most common HTTP method, but there are several you will use often. These HTTP methods are often associated with CRUD semantics.

Methods
GET	    Read
POST	  Create
PATCH	  Update
DELETE	Delete

## Request Path

Right after the HTTP method is the request's URI. This consists of a path starting with / and an optional query string after ?. The *HTTP method* and *path* are what Vapor uses to route requests (για να κάνει αιτήματα διαδρομής)

After the URI is the HTTP version followed by zero or more headers and finally a body. Since this is a GET request, it does not have a body

By according to HTTP Standard, GET should not have request body because it only do query strings 
(γιατί κάνει μόνο ερωτήματα)

Both GET and POST method is used to transfer data from client to server in HTTP protocol but Main difference between POST and GET method is that GET carries request parameter appended in URL string while POST carries request parameter in message body which makes it more secure way of transferring data from client to server

## Router Methods

Let's take a look at how this request could be handled in Vapor.

app.get("hello", "vapor") { req in 
    return "Hello, vapor!"
}

All of the common HTTP methods are available as methods on Application. They accept one or more string arguments that represent the request's path separated by /

Note that you could also write this using "on" followed by the method

app.on(.GET, "hello", "vapor") { ... }

With this route registered, the example HTTP request from above will result in the following HTTP response

### HTTP response: 
An HTTP response is made by a server to a client. The aim of the response is to provide the client with the resource it requested, or inform the client that the action it requested has been carried out; or else to inform the client that an error occurred in processing its request

the example HTTP request from above will result in the following HTTP response:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-length: 13
content-type: text/plain; charset=utf-8

Hello, vapor!

## Route Parameters

Now that we've successfully routed a request (δρομολογήσαμε ένα αίτημα) based on the HTTP method and path, let's try making the path dynamic. Notice that the name "vapor" is hardcoded in both the path and the response. Let's make this dynamic so that you can visit /hello/<any name> and get a response

app.get("hello", ":name") { req -> String in
    let name = req.parameters.get("name")!
    return "Hello, \(name)!"
}
  
By using a path component prefixed with :, we indicate to the router that this is a dynamic component. Any string supplied here will now match this route. We can then use req.parameters to access the value of the string

If you run the example request again, you'll still get a response that says hello to vapor. However, you can now include any name after /hello/ and see it included in the response. Let's try /hello/swift:

REQUEST
GET /hello/swift HTTP/1.1
content-length: 0
  
RESPONSE
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-length: 13
content-type: text/plain; charset=utf-8

Hello, swift!

## Routes

















=========================================================================================================================

Start by looking at the classes defined in the Models directory:
User: Represents a user entry in your server’s database.
Dinner: Represents a scheduled dinner.
DinnerInviteePivot: Links dinners and invited users.

When looking into these class properties, notice how Vapor 4 uses property wrappers, a new feature in Swift 5.1. The @ID, @Field and @Timestamp wrappers, among others, play an essential role for Fluent, Vapor’s database framework

Now, open the files in the Controllers folder to get a sense of how Vapor 4 handles routing

Next, open the Migrations directory and check how you add a new table and its columns to the database. Also, pay attention to how each property has additional attributes, like constraints or references to other tables








































Heroku when it is time, until then keep it local




Note: For the sake of simplicity, this tutorial uses an on-disk SQLite database. In later stages of development, and certainly in production, you should use a scalable database running on a dedicated server. Good choices include PostgreSQL and MySQL.
